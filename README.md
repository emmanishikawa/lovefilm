this is a work-in-progress personal project that allows users to take personalized film-strip photos anywhere!
'harufilm' is a south korean photobooth studio that lets people take pictures to capture memories of the day. the highlight of harufilm is the customized emojis that people can use to decorate each film-strip. as this company is primarily available in korea, i thought to develop a web-application inspired by harufilm's decoration concept, so users around the world can snap and decorate cute pictures in the comfort of their homes, but with my own personal twist.

**usage**

1. pick a film-strip size
2. take a maximum of 4 photos using your desktop web-cam
3. decorate with custom-made emojis
4. download to your computer as a PNG

**technology used**: Next.js, React, Tailwind

### next steps for the project:

- finish undo button function for emojis
- implement mobile version
- allow users to choose a custom frame
- implement custom filters for the photos
- implement timer system as an option instead of clicking a button to take pictures
- more custom emojis
- aesthetic appeal
